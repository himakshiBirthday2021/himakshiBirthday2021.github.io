		<p>Our first visit to Barbeque Nation. We had visited Chandigarh earlier this day and at this moment dad was about to collapse any moment xD. We were shit crazy for food at this time at and I for some reason became obsessed with the brush (which had to be kept separate for brushing non-veg dishes cuz apparently mumma ko ab usse bhi problem hai)</p>

		<p>We went to drop you off at the station. Even while I am writing this, my heart is so heavy. Straight off, that day sucked! All our smiles are fake, cuz deep inside, we all are sad. Thats the thing about your visits. The seeing-off business is the most difficult. Okay ab main ro na padun. shoo away.</p>
